Tic Tac Toe:
	For the coding project, we ask folks to write a tic-tac-toe game to allows us to play against a computer. It doesn't have to be perfect, but we expect not to win (so the computer always wins or ties). The player should be able to make the first move. Ideally we get a link to play and a way to see the source code when it's working. It can be in any language and there is no timeframe, since we understand this requires time that you have to fit in.
